Running performance test. This increases number of Nodes and connections in
simulation until simulation lasts for at least 10 seconds

-v is included for a more verbose test, exclude otherwise.

```
go test -bench=. -run=Bench -test.benchtime=10s -v ./...
```

Running all other tests:

```
go test -v ./...
```

Add `-count=1` flag to disable test caching
